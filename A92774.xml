            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I know not better how to extricate my ſelf, and ſtand cleare with thoſe who are to judge of all that is hereafter preſented, but by this ingenuous account. It moved me not a little to finde in print ſome ſheets <hi>pretending one way,</hi> and <hi>intending another. To ſhew the Judgement of the Reformed Churches;</hi> this way the <hi>Ivie-buſh</hi> held out:
<pb facs="tcp:115651:5"/>
and hereupon an <hi>Hiſtoricall collection</hi> out of their <hi>Conſeſſions,</hi> or <hi>Agenda's,</hi> and <hi>Books of Diſcipline,</hi> might be expected; and yet nothing is to be found out of either: And that which is produced, is only Negative, concerning one or two particulars, to the ſenſe of the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> rather then agreeable to the generall opinion of thoſe who are <hi>Orthodox.</hi> Whereas <hi>Teſtimony</hi> was the faireſt way to have proceeded in, that's waved for the moſt part, and a flouriſh of Arguments ſerv'd in inſtead of it. I conſidered, on the one hand, the preſumption of many, intruding into the work of the Miniſtery, and taking the profit, or ambitious of the credit of it; and how <hi>Some preach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of the Calling, to preach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into it;</hi> and that of late, many <hi>Old Errors</hi> are revived, under the name of <hi>New-Light,</hi> as by ſome others, ſo by many <hi>inordinate</hi> or unordained Preachers; and People, in ſtead of bleſſing God (as they ought to do) for that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery which is famous through all the Reformed Churches, and to which, as a meanes under God, <hi>Saints in England</hi> now living, or dead in this laſt Century, owe themſelves &amp; all that they are, do notwithſtanding withdraw themſelves and
<pb facs="tcp:115651:5"/>
ſeparate from it. And on the other hand, that <hi>Both the Houſes of Parliament</hi> had witneſſed againſt thoſe who Preach unordained; and one of them about the time of publiſhing of thoſe Papers which I direct an Anſwer unto, was in a way of queſtioning thoſe who Preached con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their <hi>Order:</hi> And that it is Miniſters duty to ſtrengthen the hands of Magiſtrates in well-doing, when they ſhew themſelves to be (as they ought to be) Nurſing fathers to the good, and a terror to the evill. And fearing alſo that the <hi>Diatribe</hi> was intended in oppoſition to thoſe proceedings of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or at leaſt, that it might prove prejudiciall thereunto, I was inclined to conſider of it; hoping, that as the ſheets were not many, ſo the Animadverſions which I ſhould need to make upon them, would not be long. And becauſe I had reaſon to think he looked not only <hi>forward,</hi> as if Ordination was not neceſſary <hi>for the future;</hi> but <hi>backward,</hi> as if it were nothing <hi>for the time paſt;</hi> I thought my ſelf, with all other the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the more concerned in his Poſitions. And however ſome may be offended, that <hi>Papacie</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacie</hi> ſhould be both exploded, and yet, that that <hi>Calling</hi> in a way of Ordination,
<pb facs="tcp:115651:6"/>
which is ſucceſſively from both, or one at leaſt, either in deed, or in ſhew, ſhould be reteined ſtill, and not renounced: though in my own particular I am moved at it no more, then to find <hi>Rahab</hi> and <hi>Thamar</hi> among thoſe through whoſe loynes the <hi>naturall ſucceſſion</hi> of our bleſſed Saviour is propagated from <hi>Adam,</hi> yet I have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the following <hi>Anſwer,</hi> pag. 49. <hi>&amp;</hi> 84. to remove that ſtone of ſtumbling, and rock of offence.</p>
                  <p>But whatever becomes of Calling to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery in the manner uſed <hi>heretofore;</hi> I hope it will appeare, that <hi>for the time to come</hi> it ought to be (in part at leaſt) by <hi>Ordination;</hi> and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by <hi>Laying on of hands:</hi> and that this is <hi>the Judgment of the Reformed Churches and Proteſtant Divines.</hi> Some will blame me for having ſaid <hi>ſo much;</hi> and others ſay, they expected <hi>more.</hi> But if this may be of any uſe toward the cleare diſcovery and deciſion of the Queſtion under debate, till thoſe who are <hi>better able</hi> unite their ſhrength and bring in their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, this labour is not loſt.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. In plain words, I ſuppoſe this to be your meaning: No man who deſires to be a Miniſter, needs be Ordained; and if he be, he is not thereby made a Miniſter. And this you aſſert without any diſtinction of time or ſtate of the Church, or of Calling, whether it be mediate or immediate, ordinary, extraordinary, or mixt. You might as well ſay, Mariage, as an act of Miniſters or Magiſtrates, after the conſent of the parties, is not eſſentiall to the calling of man and wife, none need to be ſo married, and if they be, they are not thereby made man and wife. Wiſe men would ſoon perceive that your word <hi>eſſentiall</hi> would not be a ſufficient <hi>ſalvo</hi> againſt the danger of ſuch a poſition; families are likely to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by it notwithſtanding. He that ſayes no act of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Elders is eſſentiall to a Miniſters call, will ſay as much with fairer pretence of Magiſtrates; and then either nothing is eſſentiall, or ſomething to be done by the people, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing immediately on Gods part: what followes upon this, but either <hi>Eraſtianiſme,</hi> that there is no Church-power or Order; <hi>Browniſme,</hi> that all power is in the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; or <hi>Enthuſiaſme,</hi> that every man is to act <hi>[in ſacris]</hi> as he is led by inſpiration, without reſpect to politie.</p>
                     <p>If this be your judgement, yet methinks it ſounds not like the judgement of the Reformed Churches and Proteſtant Divines. Papiſts uſe to impoſe ſuch a ſence upon them, and they uſe to diſclaim it. Yet I do not wonder that you are thus bold with them, ſeeing you begin with Firſt, Second, and Third, &amp;c. which muſt be underſtood either of Scripture or Reaſon, or both, as if <hi>right reaſon,</hi> and <hi>that Spirit which leadeth into all truth,</hi> were fully on your ſide in this cauſe, whereas I fear they are not.</p>

As to your poſition in your own terms, <hi>Ordination is not eſsentiall to the calling of a Miniſter;</hi> the Reader (who is to judge betwixt us both) muſt obſerve this myſterie.

If there were no other uſe of Ordination, then there is of Coronation to a King, it might ſuffice in ſome ſenſe to prove it eſſentiall to the calling of a Miniſter. If coronation among Kings in our time be of like uſe to them as anointing was to Kings among the Jews, or as impoſition of hands was unto the Elders and unto <hi>Joſhua</hi> in ſucceſſion unto <hi>Moſes.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joſh. 27. 18.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Coronation is not of the like nature in all times and places, nor in all mens judgements, who write of Politicks. And though for the moſt part it ſuppoſe ſome precedent act whereby a King receives title; yet ſuch weight is laid on this ſolemnity even among thoſe who inherit by ſucceſſion, that he who is a King thinks himſelf not rightly ſetled till he hath been crowned, and from the time of crowning the time of reigning uſes to be accounted in the Empire. <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Althus: polit. c.</hi> 19. <hi>num.</hi> 95.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. It is not ſimply right that makes a man to be a King, but the ſolemn declaration of that right in a forenſick way (which uſes to be done by proclamation) and ſome acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the right demanded, and that's by coronation. All theſe in the ſubſtance of the things muſt concurre and may be ſaid to be eſſentiall, becauſe though the outward ſign be <hi>juris poſitivi,</hi> yet the thing ſignified is <hi>juris naturalis.</hi> Apply this to the calling of a Miniſter, and ſee what follows. The conſent of thoſe who have power to make him a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter who otherwiſe is none, is ſubſtantially neceſſary. Among thoſe who have that power, I hope the Miniſters and Elders as ſuch, ſhall be allowed their ſhare. And that manner of declaring conſent, which is approveable by the fundamentall laws of the kingdom of Chriſt, is alſo neceſſary; the one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently, the other conſequently. Let Ordination be in as much requeſt among us for making Miniſters, as Coronation is for our Kings, and it ſhall ſuffice: for then, as we have no
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115651:21"/>
Kings but ſuch as are crowned, ſo we ſhall have no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters but thoſe who are ordained. Remember that you are now ſpeaking of Ordination as it is an act of Miniſters and Elders, wherein they are to conſent for making of a Miniſter. And if their conſent as ſuch, <hi>h. e.</hi> as Miniſters and Elders, be eſſentiall, though the manner of Declaring it were arbitrary, yet that will ſuffice to prove Ordination in ſome ſenſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall.</p>
                     <p>4. As for the Proteſtant writers, when they compare Ordination to Coronation; though it might ſuffice to ſay Compariſons prove nothing, <hi>(Theologica ſymbolica non eſt argumentativa)</hi> yet I anſwer further, They thereby under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand for the moſt part the rite of Ordination, or the act of Impoſition of hands as diſtinguiſhed from the foregoing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Miniſters and Elders; and in that ſenſe it may be admitted that Ordination is <hi>declaratio ſolennis, aut conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis teſtificatio, miſſio ſolennis in poſſeſſionem honoris,</hi> and ſuch like. And this will be no advantage to you, or prejudice to us. You are now to ſpeak of Ordination as diſtinguiſhed from Impoſition of hands, (for that follows afterward to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) but how the Proteſtant writers underſtand it when they compare it to Coronation, is another thing. To the teſtimonies which are cited by you, I ſhall ſpeak more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the cloſe.</p>

is, Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and People, by a ſeverall intereſt of Suffrage, are to concur, together, or apart, to the calling of a Miniſter.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115651:24"/>
Miniſter; and Ordination is that whereby he who is ſo cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen is actually made a Miniſter. And the reaſon is cleer, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe between Election and Ordination ſomething may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene to make the choiſe null in relation to the end and effect whereunto it is intended, to wit the making of ſuch a perſon to be a Miniſter. The deſigning of a perſon to be made a King, and the act of putting him into the Kingly office, as the choiſe of a meet perſon to be a wife, and that act of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage whereby ſhe is made a wife <hi>(de praeſenti)</hi> do very much differ: the laſt is the moſt formall and conſtitutive.

injoyns it agreeably unto the Word. And if it ſhould alwayes follow upon Election, yet you cannot thence conclude that the Call to the Miniſtery lies principally in Election. Marriage is begun by the motion of the man to the woman that he may have her for his wife; and yet mariage it ſelfe lies not principally in that, nor in their mutuall conſent, but in their ſolemn taking one another, and in the ratification thereof by ſuch as are in authority to allow or diſallow of ſuch deſires and purpoſes.

That he who is choſen to be a King, <hi>muſt</hi> be crowned, makes ſtill more for the neceſſity of Ordination; and if his Election gives him the right to rule, yet his Coronation only doth ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the binding of all his Subjects unto obedience, that his right is acknowledged, and he is actually put into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it.

Yet you ſhall do well to prefer <hi>reaſon</hi> before <hi>teſtimony,</hi> and to conſider that the <hi>foundation</hi> of Calling, is power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to ſet one over others in the Lord for the Miniſtery: and the <hi>terme</hi> may be indefinite or particular, or both, as the good and ſtate of the Church doth require. Election of the people can be nothing elſe but a deſire that ſuch a one may be made a Miniſter, and their Miniſter in particular; and may either go before, or follow Ordination, according to the ſtate of the perſon who is deſired. This deſire of theirs is to be ſubject, as in ſome reſpect to the perſon himſelf, ſo more eſpecially unto them who are to <hi>diſcern, judge</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine</hi> in the room of Chriſt. The ſentence of ſuch compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges is the true foundation of Calling; and the aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a particular Company to be miniſtred unto (which when they are Saints is to be done with their conſent) is the terme. All this is done in Ordination; and in that regard Ordination rightly ſtated is not an adjunct of Calling (it might be an adjunct, and yet inſeparable) but the forme it ſelf.</p>

That there muſt be a true Church before there can be a true Miniſtery, <hi>i. e.</hi> the effect before the cauſe, and the end attained before the means of attaining are provided. 2. That the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church is purely and ſtrictly Democraticall or popular; for if the People without Miniſters and Elders are ſole Judges of their own Saintſhip, and of fitneſſe for the Miniſtery, and conſequently of ſoundneſſe of Doctrine and

the right way of Worſhip, what can be denied them? 3. That a Miniſters calling, as a Miniſter, extends not beyond the bounds of a ſingle Congregation; or that one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation may make a Miniſter to ſerve themſelves or any other. 4.

That the <hi>Socinians</hi> inſiſting only upon this queſtion, <hi>[Whether a Conſtitution by way of Ordination be altogether neceſſary to the making of a Miniſter?]</hi> are not (as you think) to be oppoſed; neither are <hi>the Reformed Churches</hi> nor <hi>Proteſtant Divines</hi> of any other judgement then <hi>they:</hi> and therefore what needs <hi>Crocius</hi> to defend the Proteſtants againſt them in this point, or profeſſe himſelf <hi>Anti-Socinian?</hi> unleſſe he will ſay more for Ordination then they have done; which cannot well be, but by holding it to be eſſentiall.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It's granted, that there is leſſe neceſſity of <hi>Ordination</hi> then of <hi>Calling;</hi> yea, that Ordination is not alwayes alike neceſſary, but according to the ſtate of the Church. And it might be proved, that there is a caſe wherein it is ſo far from being neceſſary, that it is not lawfull: But it will not thence follow, that in no caſe it is eſſentiall.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thoſe Scriptures which prove the lawfulneſſe of it, will prove more: For we cannot argue from the bare exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apoſtles<hi>—Thus they did, therefore we may do the ſame.</hi> Becauſe it follows not in all things. Therefore <note place="margin">
                           <hi>De Eccl. Pontiſ. Praejud. Diſſer.</hi> 6. p. 149.</note> 
                        <hi>Crocius</hi> (in a later Work) flies to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. for his ground and proof: and there we have <hi>a precept.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution</hi> which he ſpeaks of, can be underſtood of none other then <hi>Apoſtolicall;</hi> and thoſe things which the Apoſtles wrote about <hi>Order,</hi> were <hi>commandements,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 37.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Whereas he ſayes, <hi>A Calling is neceſſary by Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;</hi> and after ſeems to ſhew what he means by <hi>Calling;</hi> namely, that the perſon conſtituted <hi>be choſen by the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent conſent of the People.</hi> You know full well, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God can be found for this way of Calling, but as it is gathered out of examples by conſequence from <hi>Act.</hi> 1.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115651:42"/>
and the 6 <hi>chap.</hi> And if <hi>thoſe examples</hi> imply a command for the Peoples <hi>Election</hi> one way, I would hear ſome ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why <hi>the like command</hi> is not to be concluded out of examples for <hi>Ordination.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Whether <hi>the antecedent conſent of the People</hi> be alwayes neceſſary, is not the point at preſent under debate. But this is his ſenſe: That the power of chooſing is the right of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> and belong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="7">7. To that <hi>That one is choſen of God, when he is adorned with gifts.</hi> I think you your ſelf make ſome ſcruple of it. When the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> have pleaded (among other things) to prove their <hi>Calling the gifts which God had given them:</hi> Thoſe of the <hi>Separation,</hi> in their Writings, are wont to tell them, <hi>Qualification is no Calling.</hi> Neither dare I ſay, Every one that is ſit to be a Miniſter, is called to be one. And in a mediate Calling, the teſtimony of competent Judges concerning <hi>Abilities,</hi> and the <hi>right</hi> to exerciſe them, is moſt neceſſary; and that uſeth to be, in the orderly way of Gods preſcribing in the Word, <hi>by Ordination.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now (Sir) give me leave to minde you of an overſight in yourſelf. You told us in your Title-page, of the <hi>Judgement of the Reformed Churches,</hi> as a diſtinct part from that of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Divines.</hi> Why are none of their <hi>Confeſſions</hi> cited, or <hi>Books of Diſcipline?</hi> Make they for you, or againſt you? If they be on your ſide, would you ſpare to tell us? Suppoſe they were againſt you, yet you might not conceale it, while you pretend to hold it out. As for particular men, their Judgement is not <hi>tanti,</hi> if it agree not with the Church in generall. He that made the <hi>Obſervations</hi> on the <hi>Harmony of Confeſſions</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> will help you out a little: but the <hi>Confeſſions</hi> themſelves are not (as it ſeems) for your turn.

                     <p>What think you of <hi>Proteſtant Eſtates?</hi> Is not their Judgement conſiderable?

                        <p>For my part, when I conſider how uniform and accurate the Apoſtles were in obſerving it, and of this rite alone in the matter of Ordination, and that we have no inſtance or example of their Ordaining otherwiſe; How unſafe it is to vary from their lawfull and imitable practiſe; What advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the Papiſts have to bring in other rites upon pretence of liberty, And what danger might be by ſubſtituting another way of Ordaining then we have ſure warrant for; Of what conſequence it is that Miniſters ſhould keep up a peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of acting <hi>in the name and ſtead of Chriſt,</hi> by ſomething peculiar to themſelves; and that <hi>this alone</hi> doth moſt cleerly hold it out, beſide the manifold uſes of it which are expreſſed by <hi>Proteſtant Divines:</hi> Though it be commonly called <hi>a rite,</hi> and in that reſpect is but <hi>an adjunct,</hi> ſo as it muſt needs ſeem harſh to call it <hi>eſſentiall;</hi> yet I judge it ſinfull for any who deſire the office of a Miniſter to refuſe it, and ſcandalous in any Church wilfully to throw i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>To which I anſwer. 1. If your Argument had truth and weight in it, it would prove, That nothing is eſſentiall which is to be performed either by the Church or her Officers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were made Miniſters by the <hi>Head</hi> alone without the <hi>Body. Paul</hi> calls himſelf <hi>an Apoſtle neither of man nor by man,</hi> Gal. 1. 1. and yet he was <hi>a Miniſter,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1.

                        <p>2. Its not enough to ſay, <hi>That ſome were made Miniſters without it;</hi> unleſſe you ſhew further, that in being made Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters they were Ordained, and that without Laying on of hands.</p>
                        <p>3. How <hi>ſome have been made Miniſters</hi> in particular caſes, as <hi>Matthias</hi> alone by lot, is not to be inſiſted on; but what's the generall rule for all in an ordinary way.</p>
                        <p>4. Were it proved that the Apoſtles have been made Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and Ordained without the Rite in queſtion; it would be little to the purpoſe, becauſe there is neither the ſame rule nor reaſon for <hi>Them</hi> and <hi>ordinary Officers.</hi>

                        <p>5. Under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> Impoſition of hands was uſed in divers caſes. As firſt <hi>in Bleſſing,</hi> Gen. 48. 14, 20.

Thirdly, <hi>in Ordaining,</hi> or appointing unto an Office; as when <hi>Joſhua</hi> was appointed to ſucceed <hi>Moſes, Moſes laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge.</hi> Num. 27. 23. <hi>Joſhua</hi> alſo is ſaid to be <hi>full of the Spirit of wiſdome, for Moſes had laid his hands on him,</hi> Deut. 34. 9. He was <hi>full of the Spirit of wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>therefore had hands laid on him,</hi> as appears <hi>Num.</hi> 27. 18. <hi>Take thee Joſhua the ſon of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thy hands upon him.</hi> As in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> the <hi>Deacons</hi> were firſt <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt and wiſdome,</hi> Act. 6. 3. and therefore they had hands laid on them, <hi>v.</hi> 6.

                           <hi>comming out to</hi> Babylon, it was not neceſſary <hi>to return back</hi> again to Popiſh Biſhops for Ordination: and to this his reaſons are ſtrong; but what is that to the regular and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of Calling? 4. It's worth obſerving how he begins: <hi>[Some chuſe to refer this to Laying on of hands.]</hi> For indeed they were not only Papiſts who urged the neceſſity of having hands laid on, (and it ſeems from this place) but Proteſtants alſo were offended with the <hi>firſt Reformers in France,</hi> for want of ſucceſſion in the way of Ordination. Which gave occaſion to <hi>Sadeel</hi> to write a ſpeciall Treatiſe <hi>(De legitima vocatione Paſtorum Eccleſiae Reformatae)</hi> againſt thoſe who profeſſed to differ from the reſt <hi>(in hoc tantùm capite) in this point only,</hi> That Miniſters wanted a lawfull Calling, for want of ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times. And therefore you muſt not wonder if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſwade all men to be of your mind, eſpecially when your reaſons are far from cogencie: And <hi>Beza,</hi> from whom you might expect ſomething, and make a ſhew of much, waves the determining of that on the place, which was moſt proper to it. 5. If it be ſaid, he gives <hi>certain marks</hi> of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and yet reckons not Impoſition of hands for one. As 1. the Teſtimony; 2. the Election of the Church, (for that's in the <hi>Latine,</hi> though you leave it out in the <hi>tranſlation)</hi> and 3. Confirmation by prayer. I anſwer, theſe ſuffice when the condition of the Church will not poſſibly afford more, yea leſſe then theſe: The ediſication of the Church is ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that it muſt be endeavoured as Providence makes way; but when there may be <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> obſerved, its ſinfull to neglect the rules and means of procuring and upholding it.

Yet I anſwer, 1. In the connexion of theſe words either to thoſe immediately foregoing, or to the beginning of the Paragraph, you make the <hi>Lutherans</hi> Theeves and Hirelings, or exclude them out of the number of the Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which is extreme uncharitable. 2. Though the <hi>Lutherans</hi> do not hold Laying on of hands to be eſſentiall, yet they need not fear a nullity in their Calling, having Impoſition by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and uſing it ſtill. The act it ſelf is of force, though they ſhould erre in the grounds of uſing it. 3. To hold Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands to be <hi>abſolutely neceſſary in all caſes,</hi> may well be counted <hi>Popery;</hi> if we think thoſe hands muſt be a <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and that Biſhop conſecrated by a power derived from the <hi>Sea of Rome,</hi> as Papiſts do: But to hold Laying on of hands ſuch a rite as <hi>ought not to be omitted</hi> by thoſe who have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the Word to uſe it, in deſigning a meet perſon to the Miniſtery, and in the viſible declaration of that deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is no <hi>Popery.</hi> 4. In this paſſage you deal fraudulently with your credulous Readers, while you pretend to tell them <hi>the Judgement of Proteſtant Divines,</hi> and do purpoſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it. <hi>Tarnovius</hi> in that very place which you point at in your margin, propounding the queſtion <hi>(De impoſitionis manuum neceſſitate) Concerning the neceſſity of Laying on of hands,</hi> ſuppoſeth a neceſſity more or leſſe to be granted on both ſides between <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans;</hi> and having ſet down <hi>Bellarmines</hi> opinion, afterward gives this for his own and others of that part. <hi>Nos eum</hi> (ſpeaking of this rite) <hi>neceſſarium exiſtimamus ſecundum quid, nimirum quia citra ſcandalum omitti hodie non poteſt, qui tot annos in Eccleſia uſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus fuit, &amp; habet ſuos uſus.</hi> What need you cite <hi>Tarnovius</hi> only to let us know what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſayes and will not let us know the judgement of <hi>Tarnovius</hi> himſelf; if it were not upon deſigne to rake up all that may be ſaid againſt that Rite, and to hury (as much as in you lies) all that makes for it. 5.

Laying on of hands is eſtabliſhed for continuance, becauſe only the ſudden laying on is forbidden, and whatſoever is commanded about Ordination is eſſentiall to it. But this you take no notice of; only you deviſe a Reaſon which I know not who will owne, and think perhaps to be applauded for your anſwer.</p>

As for example,</hi> Prayer <hi>is put for the whole worſhip of God, yet it is not the principall part of worſhip; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> keeping the Sabbath <hi>is put for all the Worſhip; as</hi> Iſa. 56. 4. <hi>Again, as when the Scripture by the ſame figure puts lifting up of hands for Election (as it doth</hi> Act. 14. 23) <hi>it binds not to that in all Elections, nor placeth it the eſſence of a choice in that: ſo neither doth the Scripture place the chief part or eſſence of Ordination in laying on of hands, though it put it for that work.</hi>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Though laying on of hands was uſed at other times, as well as at Ordination; yet there is no reaſon why we ſhould imagine that in this Text it refers to any other thing becauſe the Chapter ſpeaks for the moſt part of things belonging to Elders. 2. Be it granted that laying on of hands was uſed in other caſes beſides that of appointing Officers: yet the uſe of it in ordaining Elders is <hi>one thing,</hi> if it be not the <hi>only thing</hi> here intended. 3. This argument will ſurely hold. <hi>Laying on of hands is put for appointing Miniſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in appointing Miniſters its lawfull to lay on hands.</hi> As this: <hi>Prayer and keeping the Sabbath are put for Worſhip, therefore they belong to Worſhip.</hi> And if becauſe they be put for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they are therefore parts of Worſhip; then Impoſition of hands is part of Ordination, becauſe its put for Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

as you underſtand Election; and if you will needs have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection underſtood there, it will follow that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> did both <hi>elect</hi> and <hi>ordain;</hi> and while you graſp in all for the People, you will leave them nothing. 4. If <hi>lifting up of hands</hi> by the people, were as directly intended and as often expreſſed as <hi>laying on of hands</hi> by Apoſtles &amp; Elders is, your zeale for the People would make you think it neceſſary.

But upon the ſuppoſition that there are two ſorts of Elders, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by other places, they may be included under that one word, becauſe its comprehenſive of them both.

                        <p>To your third inſinuation, <hi>that Calling and Impoſition of hands are equally preſt.</hi> I anſwer, 1. Were it ſo, you need not wonder; becauſe there are few who zealouſly oppoſe the one, but they oppoſe the other alſo: if you mean it of a Church-Call, the thing it ſelf is ſtruck at. Moſt of thoſe who care not for having Hands laid on them, do as little value the Peoples choice; were it not that the people are
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115651:61"/>
purſ-bearers, &amp; the <hi>beneficium</hi> is ſure to come from them, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever conveighs the <hi>officium.</hi> Gifted men would plead only the right of their own gifts, but that the Peoples gifts byas them towards the peoples Call. 2. He that ſcruples to have Hands laid on him, may well be ſuſpected to queſtion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; the rather, becauſe they make a new Sect beyond all in ordinary enumeration, who pretend the unlawfulneſſe of this Rite: and therefore Church and State have need to watch againſt the creeping in of ſuch.</p>
                        <p>To the laſt, <hi>That nothing ſhould be preſt about the Calling of a Miniſter, but what is eſſentiall.</hi> I anſwer; Conſider of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications whether every one of them be eſſentiall or no: if they be not; yet whether they may not be preſt? Is there any Church in the world that urgeth only eſſentials? Many things may be ſaid for Impoſition of hands, that cannot be ſaid for every rite, if it be but a rite. This is to me in ſtead of all: That liberty, whereby we pretend to lay aſide <hi>this,</hi> will imholden us to deviſe <hi>ſome other</hi> in ſtead of it; and that's (at leaſt) dangerous. Be it but an adjunct, in one ſenſe it will prove an inſeparable one; Ordination is likely to fall with it, and this monſter like to ariſe in the room of it: the Church will be all body, in viſible adminiſtrations to it ſelf, to act her own part and Chriſts, confuſedly.</p>
